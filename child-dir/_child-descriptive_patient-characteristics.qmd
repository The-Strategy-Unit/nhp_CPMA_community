In this section, the number and percentage of mitigable activity for the `r cohort_title` cohort are shown by patient characteristics: age, ethnic category, IMD decile and sex. Crude rates per 100,000 population are also provided for context.

Outputs are presented for both admissions and beddays, but patterns are broadly similar across the two.
