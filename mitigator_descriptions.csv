eol_care_2_days,"This cohort includes admissions where a patient dies in hospital within 2 days of admission, where there is no indication they experienced any trauma and no procedure is carried out. These admissions may be been avoided by appriopriate support in an alternative setting. "
eol_care_3_to_14_days,"This cohort includes admissions where a patient dies in hospital 3-14 days after admission, where there is no indication they experienced any trauma and no procedure is carried out. These admissions may be been avoided by appriopriate support in an alternative setting. "
falls_related_admissions,"This cohort includes emergency admissions related to falls in those aged 65 or over. Admissions are classed as fall related and included in this cohort if a) there is a fall related ICD10 code and a traumatic injury (explicit), b) the primary diagnosis ICD code is R296 (Tendency to fall) or, c) the diagnosis code is for one of a number of fractures that are commonly associated with a fall. Some of these admissions may be potentially avoidable if appropriate preventative services are in place, such as home risk assessments for trip hazards, strength and balance training for those at risk and falls telemonitoring. "
frail_elderly_high,"This cohort includes emergency admissions of older patients with a high level of frailty, specifically, those 75 years of age or over and a frailty score over 15. The frailty score is calculated from ICD-10 diagnoses recorded for admissions during the previous 2 years and using the risk scores in Gilbert et al (2018), Development and validation of a Hospital Frailty Risk Score focusing on older people in acute care settings using electronic hospital records: an observational study. The Lancet, 391(10132), pp.1775-1782."
frail_elderly_intermediate,"This cohort includes emergency admissions of older patients with an intermediate level of frailty, specifically, those 75 years of age or over and a frailty score between 5 and 15. The frailty score is calculated from ICD-10 diagnoses recorded for admissions during the previous 2 years and using the risk scores in Gilbert et al (2018), Development and validation of a Hospital Frailty Risk Score focusing on older people in acute care settings using electronic hospital records: an observational study. The Lancet, 391(10132), pp.1775-1782."
medicines_related_admissions_explicit,"This cohort includes emergency admissions where  the presence of one or more ICD10 diagnosis codes indicate the use of a medicine is a factor in the admission. Admissions can occur due to drug therapy failure, adverse reactions to drug therapy, failure to adhere to prescribed regimen or unintentional overdose. Admissions of this type could potentially be prevented with better self management on the patients’ part or improved medicines management."
medicines_related_admissions_implicit_anti_diabetics,"This cohort includes emergency admissions where an anti-diabetic medication related cause is not explicitly recorded but may be a factor in the admission, for example a diagnosis code related to hypoglycaemic or diabetes mellitus, along with a medication related adverse event code.  Admissions of this type could potentially be prevented with better self management on the patients’ part or improved medicines management."
medicines_related_admissions_implicit_benzodiasepines," This cohort includes emergency admissions where a benzopiasepine related cause is not explicitly recorded but may be a factor in the admission. For example a diagnosis code related to mental or behavioural disorders or a diagnosis code related to an injury/fracture, along with a medication related adverse event code. Admissions of this type could potentially be prevented with better self management on the patients’ part or improved medicines management."
medicines_related_admissions_implicit_diurectics," This cohort includes emergency admissions where a diurectic related cause is not explicitly recorded but may be a factor in the admission. For example a diagnosis code related to dehydration or hypertension, along with a medication related adverse event code. Admissions of this type could potentially be prevented with better self management on the patients’ part or improved medicines management."
medicines_related_admissions_implicit_nsaids," This cohort includes emergency admissions where a Non-Steroidal Anti-Inflamatory (NSAIDs) related cause is not explicitly recorded but may be a factor in the admission. For example, an admission with a primary diagnosis of gastric ulcer and a secondary diagnosis of arthritis, along with a medication related adverse event code, which may suggest long term use of high dose NSAIDs as a possible cause of admission. Admissions of this type could potentially be prevented with better self management on the patients’ part or improved medicines management."
readmission_within_28_days,This cohort includes readmissions occurring within 28 days of the person being discharged from hospital.
zero_los_no_procedure_adult,This cohort includes emergency admissions for those aged 18 or over where they are are admitted and discharged on the same day (i.e. length of stay is zero) and have no procedures performed during the admission.
zero_los_no_procedure_child,This cohort includes emergency admissions for those under 18 years of age where they are are admitted and discharged on the same day (i.e. length of stay is zero) and have no procedures performed during the admission.
alcohol_partially_attributable_acute,This cohort includes admissions for acute conditions that can be attributable to excess alcohol consumption. Only a proportion of admissions for each condition are included based on the alcohol attributable fraction (AAF) for that condition. As an example the AAF for fall related injuries for males aged between 35 and 44 is 17% therefore 17% of admissions meeting these criteria are included in our analysis. Conditions and AAFs are taken from - https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/alcohol-attributable-fractions-for-england-an-update
alcohol_partially_attributable_chronic,This cohort includes admissions for chronic conditions that can be attributable to excess alcohol consumption. Only a proportion of admissions for each condition are included based on the alcohol attributable fraction (AAF) for that condition. As an example the AAF for cancer of the oesophagus for males aged between 35 and 44 is 52% therefore only 52% of admissions meeting these criteria are included within our analysis. Conditions and AAFs are taken from - https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/alcohol-attributable-fractions-for-england-an-update
alcohol_wholly_attributable,This cohort includes admissions for those aged 16 and over activity where there is a diagnosis code that specifies a condition directly related to alcohol consumption. For example accidental poisoning by and exposure to alcohol  or alcoholic liver disease. 
obesity_related_admissions,"This cohort includes admissions for conditions that can be attributed to obesity. Only a proportion of admissions for each condition are included based on the obesity attributable fraction (OAF) for that condition. As an example, the OAF for hypertension is 36%.

smoking,"This cohort includes admssions for conditions that can be attributed to smoking. Only a proportion of admissions for each condition are included based on the smoking attributable fraction (SAF) for that condition. As an example, the SAF for cancer of the larynx for males is 43%, therefore only 43% of admissions meeting these criteria are included in our analysis. The conditions and SAFs are taken from- https://www.rcp.ac.uk/improving-care/resources/hiding-in-plain-sight-treating-tobacco-dependency-in-the-nhs/"
raid_ae,"This cohort includes admissions where a person was admitted from the emergency department with a primary diagnosis is from ICD10 chapter F (mental and behavioural disorders) and where no procedure was conducted. This group includes those with conditions such as self harm, acute psychosis, or drug and alcohol related issues, who may benefit from psychiatric liaison. "
intentional_self_harm,This cohort includes emergency admission where there is a diagnosis code relating to intentional self-harm. Diagnosis codes used are found here- https://icd.who.int/browse10/2019/en#/X60-X84
medically_unexplained_related_admissions,"This cohort includes emergency admissions where the primary diagnosis is one of a small basket of symptoms where a physiological cause is in many cases undetectable. For example it includes diagnosis codes for chest pain, sleep disorders, headaches, dizziness and palpitations."
virtual_wards_activity_avoidance_ari,"This cohort includes emergency admissions of those 18 or over with acute respiratory infections who may be suitable for admission to a virtual ward; virtual wards allow patients to receive the care they need at home, safely and conveniently rather than in hospital."
virtual_wards_activity_avoidance_heart_failure,"This cohort includes emergency admissions of those aged 18 or over with heart failure who may be suitable for admission to a virtual ward; virtual wards allow patients to receive the care they need at home, safely and conveniently rather than in hospital."
emergency_elderly,"This cohort includes emergency admissions for all patients aged 75 and over. These patients typically have long lengths of stay and thus represent a significant efficiency opportunity through process improvements, interventions or pathway developments to help to reduce Length of Stay (LoS). "
stroke_early_supported_discharge,"This cohort includes emergency admissions with a stroke related HRG code, where patients may benefit from a reduced inpatient length of stay through earlier supported discharge with care transferred to a community setting. "
raid_ip,"This cohort includes emergency admissions where there is a diagnosis of mental or behavioural conditions. Patients with mental health problems admitted to hospital in an emergency can have longer lengths of stay due to added complexities, so there is an efficiency opportunity to reduce  length of stay through use of psychiatric liaison services and provision of appropriate post discharge support."
prevention,This analysis includes mitigators where the mechanism of action is through Prevention of activity. This includes hospital activity which may be avoided via prevention and public health interventions. 
redirection_substitution,This analysis includes mitigators where the mechanism of action is through Redirection/Substitution of activity. This means that some of the admissions in this group could be avoided by greater use of other services/provisions in the community (either existing or new).
efficiencies,"This analysis includes mitigators where the mechanism of action is through Efficiencies. This means cohorts where although admissions may not be mitigatble, the number of beddays could potentially be mitigated. For this reason the analysis is focused on beddays."
efficiencies_relocation,This analysis includes mitigators related to Efficiencies and Relocation.
