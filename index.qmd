# Preface & User guide {.unnumbered}

The aim of this work is to understand the scale, trends, and regional variations of potentially mitigable hospital activity at national and sub-national levels.

The report was produced by [The Strategy Unit](https://www.strategyunitwm.nhs.uk/), and was funded by NHS England.

## Outline of the report

This report allows users to explore potentially mitigable acute activity.

The initial chapter gives an overall summary of the [total potentially mitigable activity](summary_of_total_mitigation.qmd)

There are 4 mechanisms through which mitigation can occurs and for each of these there is a summary page:

-   [Efficiencies](mechanism_efficiencies.qmd)

-   [Efficiencies & Relocation](mechanism_efficiencies_relocation.qmd)

-   [Prevention](mechanism_prevention.qmd)

-   [Redirection/Substitution](mechanism_redirection_substitution.qmd)

Then there are individual pages for each of the 29 mitigators, which are divided up to their mechanism groups.

All of the pages follow the same format and contain sections for:

-   Descriptive analysis - to explore potentially mitigable activity by patient characteristics (age, ethnic category, Index of Multiple Deprivation decile and sex) and admission characteristics (length of stay and specialty).
-   Cohort overlap - to understand where activity falls into more than one type of mitigator.
-   Comparative analysis - to explore how rates compare by Integrated Care Boards (ICB) and Local Authority (LA).
-   Trends - to explore how the potentially mitigatble activity has changed over time in England and also at ICB and LA level.

Analyses for the number of admissions and number of beddays is presented. For Efficiency mitigators, analysis of admissions is not included since admissions for this cohort are not considered avoidable, but it is thought that the length of stays could be reduced so analysis of beddays is presented.

There is also a page containing detailed [Methodology](methods.qmd).
