# Quantifying mitigable activity: NHP Community Mitigators

In planning for the future, whether for sizing a new hospital or managing the pattern of service utilisation across a local health and care system, a judgement needs to be made about how demand and resultant activity will change over time. There are a number of components to this but one aspect is how changes to the way we provide services might change patterns of utilisation. In particular, how might different ways of working in 'the community' (including preventative approaches and greater use of technology) act to reduce demand for hospital treatment, i.e. mitigation of hospital activity.

This analysis focuses on potentially mitigable inpatient activity that relates to community alternatives - sometimes called the 'left shift'. This move 'from hospital to community' is one of the three strategic shifts set for the NHS by the current Government.

Analysis was conducted to understand the scale, trends, and regional variations of potentially mitigable hospital activity at national and sub-national levels. This repo contains the code required to run the analyses and generate the report in a quarto book format.
