# Quantifying mitigable activity: NHP Community Mitigators

In planning for the future, whether for sizing a new hospital or managing the overall pattern of service utilisation across a local health and care system, a judgement needs to be made about how demand and resultant activity will change over time. There are a number of components to this but one aspect is how changes to the way we provide services might serve to change patterns of utilisation. In particular, how might different ways of working in 'the community' (including preventative approaches and greater use of technology) act to reduce demand for hospital treatment (mitigation).

This analysis focuses on potentially mitigable activity that relates to community alternatives - sometimes called the 'left shift' - and which is one of the three strategic shifts set for the NHS by the current Government ('from hospital to community').

Analysis was conducted to understand the scale, trends, and regional variations of potentially mitigable hospital activity at national and sub-national levels.
