# Introduction

### The New Hospitals Programme (NHP)

The government has committed to building more than 40 new hospitals by 2030. The New Hospital Programme (NHP), a partnership between DHSC and NHSE, aims to ensure that this new hospital infrastructure will meet the future needs of the population and represent value for money.

Estimating future activity levels is a critical early step in scaling and designing new hospital infrastructure. The Strategy Unit has developed a Demand and Capacity Modelling Tool to support DHSC and its stakeholders to make robust and auditable assessments of activity that hospitals may need to accommodate in future.

### Activity Mitigation

One component of the Demand and Capacity Modelling Tool is activity mitigation.

A key principle in current healthcare planning is the need to shift care delivery away from acute hospital settings and toward alternative community-based settings. This approach assumes that certain subsets of hospital activity can be addressed through redirection to other services, substitution with alternative provisions (existing or new), or through prevention.

The Strategy Unit has developed a set of algorithms to identify subsets of mitigable hospital activity using routine datasets, such as Hospital Episode Statistics (HES). These algorithms, refined over several years and informed by diverse evidence sources, underpin the mitigation components of the New Hospitals Demand and Capacity Model.

The analysis within this report focuses on activity related to 29 of the inpatient mitigators. This analysis includes all activity that meets the criteria for mitigable activity, but it should be noted that only a proportion of this activity would be mitigable in practice.

### Aims

The aim of this work is to understanding the scale, trends, and regional variations of potentially mitigable hospital activity at national and sub-national levels to inform strategic healthcare planning.

Specifically,

-   Quantify the current scale (2023/24) of mitigable activity in terms of hospital admissions and beddays in total for all identified mitigators and for individual mitigators.

-   Provide descriptive analysis of the demographic and clinical characteristics of activity within each mitigator cohort.

-   Identify and quantify overlaps between mitigators to highlight potential scale and risks of double counting.

-   Conduct comparative analysis of mitigable activity levels in total and for each mitigator across sub-national regions.

-   Examine trends over time in mitigable activity at national and sub-national levels, both in total for all identified mitigators and and for individual mitigators.

## Report layout

This report includes 3 levels of analysis:

-   **Summary of total potential mitigation**, this summarises the total mitigable activity for England, including trends and comparative analysis of total potential mitigation for ICB and LA areas. It also illustrates the overlap of mitigators and potential for double counting of activity.
-   **Summary of total potential mitigation by mechanism of mitigation group**. The mitigators can be divided into 4 groups based on the mechanism by which mitigation could occurs: Redirection/Substitution, Prevention, Relocation & Efficiencies and Efficiencies. Therefore there are 4 pages each one summarising the total potential mitigation for one of the mechanism of mitigation groups.
-   29 pages, one for each **Individual mitigator cohort** included within this analysis

Activity avoidance mitigators in yellow impact the number of admissions and therefore also beddays.

Efficiency mitigators in grey will impact length of stay, and so only affect beddays.
