### Structure of book

This book allows users to explore potentially mitigable acute activity. There are chapters for all [potential mitigable activity](summary_of_total_mitigation.qmd), the four mechanisms of mitigation [Efficiencies](mechanism_efficiencies.qmd), [Efficiencies & Relocation](mechanism_efficiencies_relocation.qmd), [Prevention](mechanism_prevention.qmd) and [Redirection/Substitution](mechanism_redirection_substitution.qmd) and each of the 29 individual mechanisms. 

Within each of these chapter there are sections for:

- Descriptive analysis - to explore potentially mitigable activity by patient characteristics (age, ethnic category, Index of Multiple Deprivation decile and sex) and admission characteristics (length of stay and specialty).
- Cohort overlap - to understand where activity falls into more than one type of mitigator.
- Comparative analysis - to explore how rates compare by Integrated Care Boards (ICB) and Local Authority (LA).
- Trends - to explore how the potentially mitigatble activity has changed over time in England and also at ICB and LA level.

Analyses for the number of admissions and number of beddays is presented. For Efficiency mitigators, analysis of admissions is not included since admissions for this cohort are not considered avoidable, but it is thought that the length of stays could be reduced so analysis of beddays is presented.

There is also a chapter for [Methodology](methods.qmd).
